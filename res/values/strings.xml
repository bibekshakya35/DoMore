	<string name="info_general">Welcome to Eat More! This app is designed to make 
	    it easier for people around the world to get suggestions of restaurants near them.
	    Now, you may ask, how is this different from other apps? Well, the idea behind our design is
	    to make the experience as simple as possible without detracting from user experience.
	    In addition, it offers an alarm system that is not seen in any other suggestion-based app.</string>
    <string name="info_alarms">Imagine you have a business meeting in two days. You don\'t know the area
        very well and there is way too much on your mind for you to be thinking about lunch that day. Well,
        our alarm system allows for users to set a specific time and day that
        they want to receive a restaurant suggestion. When this time comes, the user receives a notification with 
        an option to view nearby places.</string>
	<string name="info_nearby">If not selected from the notification menu, the user may also choose
	    to view nearby places from inside the app. They appear as a list where each item may be
	    selected to view detailed information. There is also an option to view these places on
	    a map to see where they are in relation to you.</string>
